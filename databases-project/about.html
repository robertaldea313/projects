  Inspired by the rose-hued buildings of old Marrakech,<br>
   palatial Amanjena is close to the fabled Red City, <br>
  set in its own expanse of gardens and grand open spaces.<br><br>
  Shaded courtyards with fountains lead <br>
  to the central bassin that nourishes the gardens in which <br>
  spacious standalone guest pavilions and maisons rest,<br>
    all with private gardens and many with private pools.<br><br>
   Views stretch across the olive groves and palms of the oasis,<br>
    extending to the High Atlas Mountains on the horizon.<br><br>

Spend time relaxing by the pool,<br>
 enjoy a game of tennis on one of Amanjenaâ€™s clay courts,<br>
  take to the 27-hole Amelkis Golf Course which sits next door,<br>
   or visit the otherworldly landscape of the Agafay dunes deep in the desert.
